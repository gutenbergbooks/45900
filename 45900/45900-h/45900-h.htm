&#182; This record of the personnel who have shed luster upon the service
by upholding the honor of the flag in storm and battle, by their
devotion to the country and to each other, and by their unselfishness
in risking their own lives to save others, is especially commended to
the rising generation of American seamen, that they may emulate the
deeds of their heroic predecessors, and maintain that high standard of
gallantry which has always characterized the personnel of the United
States naval service.

MEDAL OF HONOR.
</p>


<p>
The original medal of honor was designed during the Civil War by A. C.
Paquet. The medal proper, a bronze five-pointed star bearing a
star-rimmed medallion of Minerva driving before her shield the figure
of Discord, was suspended by an anchor from the bottom buckle of a
ribbon having a blue band over thirteen vertical stripes of red and
white. This ribbon was attached at top and bottom to buckles of bronze,
the bottom buckle bearing a star.
</p>

<p>
Medal and ribbon were worn on the left breast until 1913. In that year
the medal was placed in its present distinctive position at the neck of
the wearer, being detached from its original ribbon and worn as a
pendant from a ribbon band woven through the anchor ring. The ribbon
band, which is of light blue with a cluster of thirteen small stars, is
worn around the neck.
</p>

<p>
The second medal of honor, added in 1919, is from the design of Tiffany
&#38; Co., of New York. The medal, which is of gold, is in the form of a
cross superimposed upon a wreath of leaves. The center of the cross
bears the arms of the United States, framed by the inscription "United
States Navy, 1917-1918," and each arm of cross contains an anchor.
</p>

<p>
The new medal of honor is suspended from a ribbon consisting of a
triple chevron of thirteen white stars on a light blue field, the star
at point of chevron being uppermost. At the crest of this ribbon is a
bar which bears the single word "Valour." The new medal of honor is
also worn at the neck as a pendant, but in contrast to the old medal,
which is suspended direct from the ribbon band worn around the neck,
the new medal is suspended from the band by means of its ribbon.
</p>

<p>
The service ribbon bar worn in lieu of either medal of honor is light
blue and bears a cluster of white stars.

<p>
<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the President
of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to present, in
the name of Congress, a medal of honor to any person who, while in the
naval service of the United States, shall, in action involving actual
conflict with the enemy, distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry
and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of
duty and without detriment to the mission of his command or the command
to which attached.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 2.</span> That the President be, and he hereby is, further
authorized to present, but not in the name of Congress, a
distinguished-service medal of appropriate design and a ribbon,
together with a rosette or other device to be worn in lieu thereof, to
any person who, while in the naval service of the United States, since
the sixth day of April, nineteen hundred and seventeen, has
distinguished, or who hereafter shall distinguish, himself by
exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 3.</span> That the President be, and he hereby is, further
authorized to present, but not in the name of Congress, a Navy cross of
appropriate design and a ribbon, together with a rosette or other
device to be worn in lieu thereof, to any person who, while in the
naval service of the United States, since the sixth day of April,
nineteen hundred and seventeen, has distinguished, or who shall
hereafter distinguish, himself by extraordinary heroism or
distinguished service in the line of his profession, such heroism or
service not being sufficient to justify the award of a medal of honor
or a distinguished-service medal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 4.</span> That each enlisted or enrolled person of the naval
service to whom is awarded a medal of honor, distinguished-service
medal, or a Navy cross shall, for each such award, be entitled to
additional pay at the rate of $2 per month from the date of the
distinguished act or service on which the award is based, and each bar,
or other suitable emblem or insignia, in lieu of a medal of honor,
distinguished-service medal, or Navy cross, as hereinafter provided
for, shall entitle him to further additional pay at the rate of $2 per
month from the date of the distinguished act or service for which the
bar is awarded, and such additional pay shall continue throughout his
active service, whether such service shall or shall not be continuous.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 5.</span> That no more than one medal of honor or one
distinguished-service medal or one Navy cross shall be issued to any
one person; but for each succeeding deed or service sufficient to
justify the award of a medal of honor or a distinguished-service medal
or Navy cross, respectively, the President may award a suitable bar, or
other suitable emblem or insignia, to be worn with the decoration, and
the corresponding rosette or other device.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 6.</span> That the Secretary of the Navy is hereby authorized to
expend from the appropriation "Pay of the Navy" of the Navy Department
so much as may be necessary to defray the cost of the medals of honor,
distinguished-service medals, and Navy crosses, and bars, emblems, or
insignia herein provided for, and so much as may be necessary to
replace any medals, crosses, bars, emblems, or insignia as are herein
or may heretofore have been provided for: <i>Provided</i>, That such
replacement shall be made only in those cases where the medal of honor,
distinguished-service medal, or Navy cross, or bar, emblem, or insignia
presented under the provisions of this or any other act shall have been
lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use without fault or neglect on
the part of the person to whom it was awarded, and shall be made
without charge therefor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 7.</span> That, except as otherwise prescribed herein, no medal
of honor, distinguished-service medal, Navy cross, or bar or other
suitable emblem or insignia in lieu of either of said medals or of said
cross, shall be issued to any person after more than five years from
the date of the act or service justifying the award thereof, nor unless
a specific statement or report distinctly setting forth the act or
distinguished service and suggesting or recommending official
recognition thereof shall have been made by his naval superior through
official channels at the time of the act or service or within three
years thereafter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 8.</span> That in case an individual who shall distinguish
himself dies before the making of the award to which he may be entitled
the award may nevertheless be made and the medal or cross or the bar or
other emblem or insignia presented within five years from the date of
the act or service justifying the award thereof to such representative
of the deceased as the President may designate: <i>Provided</i>, That
no medal or cross or no bar or other emblem or insignia shall be
awarded or presented to any individual or to the representative of any
individual whose entire service subsequent to the time he distinguished
himself shall not have been honorable: <i>Provided further</i>, That in
cases of persons now in the naval service for whom the award of the
medal of honor has been recommended in full compliance with then
existing regulations, but on account of services which, though
insufficient fully to justify the award of the medal of honor, appears
to have been such as to justify the award of the distinguished-service
medal or Navy cross hereinbefore provided for, such cases may be
considered and acted upon under the provisions of this act authorizing
the award of the distinguished-service medal and Navy cross
notwithstanding that said services may have been rendered more than
five years before said cases shall have been considered as authorized
by this proviso, but all consideration or any action upon any of said
cases shall be based exclusively upon official records now on file in
the Navy Department.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Sec. 9.</span> That the President be, and he hereby is, authorized to
delegate, under such conditions, regulations, and limitations as he
shall prescribe, to flag officers who are commanders in chief or
commanding on important independent duty the power conferred upon him
by this act to award the Navy cross; and he is further authorized to
make from time to time any and all rules, regulations, and orders which
he shall deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this act
and to execute the full purpose and intention thereof.

SECOND MEDAL.

<p>
"On November 17, 1915, it was planned to attack Fort Riviere, Haiti,
with a force made up of detachments from the Fifth, Thirteenth,
Twenty-third Companies, and the marine detachment and sailors from the
<i>Connecticut</i>. Fort Riviere was an old French bastion fort, about
200 feet on the side, with thick walls of brick and stone, the walls
being loopholed. The original entrance had been on the northern side,
but had been blocked, a small breach in the southern wall being used in
its stead. As this breach in the wall was the only entrance to the
fort, it was naturally covered by the defenders on the inside, making
passage through it into the fort a most hazardous undertaking for the
leading men. Notwithstanding the fact that the fire of the Cacos was
constantly passing through this hole in the wall, Sergt. Ross L. Iams,
Fifth Company, unhesitatingly jumped through, closely followed by Pvt.
Samuel Gross of the Twenty-third company. A m&#234;l&#233;e then ensued inside of
the fort for about 10 minutes, the Cacos fighting desperately with
rifles, clubs, stones, etc., during which several jumped from the walls
in an effort to escape, but were shot by the automatic guns of the
Fifth Company and by the Thirteenth Company advancing to the attack."
</p>

<p>
It is urged that Maj. Smedley D. Butler be given a medal of honor for
his conspicuous bravery during the assault on Fort Riviere. Two men
entered ahead of him, doing so to prevent him from being the first.
Theirs was devotion to him, while his action was devotion to duty. The
assault inside the fort was made by 23 men with the knowledge that no
quarter would be given them.

SECOND MEDAL.
</p>

<p>
Gunnery sergeant, United States Marine Corps. "On October 22, 1915,
Captain Upshur, First Lieutenant Ostermann, First Lieutenant Miller,
Assistant Surgeon Borden, and 35 enlisted men of the Fifteenth Company
of Marines, all mounted, left Fort Liberte, Haiti, for a six-day
reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of October 24, while crossing
river in deep ravine, the detachment was suddenly fired upon from three
sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100 yards from fort.
The marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position, which
it maintained during the night, although subjected to a continuous fire
from the Cacos. At daybreak the marines, in three squads, commanded by
Captain Upshur, Lieutenant Ostermann, and Gunnery Sergeant Daly,
advanced in three different directions, surprising and scattering the
Cacos in all directions. The expeditionary commander commented on the
gallantry displayed by the officers and men of this detachment in the
following language:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The action of 35 men in the attack made upon them during the night
of October 24 can not be commended too highly. It is true that
these men were in pitch darkness, surrounded by ten times their
number and fighting for their lives, but the manner in which they
fought during that long night, the steady, cool discipline that
prevented demoralization, is remarkable. Had one squad failed, not
one man of the party would have lived to tell the story. The actual
assault upon the enemy, made in three different directions and
beginning as soon as the light permitted them to see, was splendid.
It meant success or utter annihilation. It succeeded, thanks to the
splendid examples given by the officers and noncommissioned
officers, supported by the men. Upshur and Ostermann advancing from
two directions captured Fort Dipitie with a total of 13 marines,
putting garrison to flight. Demolished and burned fort. All three
squads burned all houses from which fire had been coming. I
believe, therefore, that Capt. William P. Upshur, First Lieut.
Edward A. Ostermann, and Gunnery Sergt. Daniel Daly should be given
medals of honor for this particular engagement and the work of the
following day.
</p>

<p>
"On November 17, 1915, it was planned to attack Fort Riviere,
Haiti, with a force made up of detachments from the Fifth,
Thirteenth, Twenty-third Companies, and the marine detachment and
sailors from the <i>Connecticut</i>. Fort Riviere was an old French
bastion fort, about 200 feet on the side, with thick walls of brick
and stone, the walls being loopholed. The original entrance had
been on the northern side, but had been blocked, a small breach in
the southern wall being used in its stead. As this breach in the
wall was the only entrance to the fort, it was naturally covered by
the defenders on the inside, making passage through it into the
fort a most hazardous undertaking for the leading men.
Notwithstanding the fact that the fire of the Cacos was constantly
passing through this hole in the wall, Sergt. Ross L. Iams, Fifth
Company, unhesitatingly jumped through, closely followed by Pvt.
Samuel Gross, of the Twenty-third Company. A m&#234;l&#233;e then ensued
inside of the fort for about 10 minutes, the Cacos fighting
desperately with rifles, clubs, stones, etc., during which several
jumped from the walls in an effort to escape, but were shot by the
automatic guns of the Fifth Company and by the Thirteenth Company
advancing to the attack."

walls of brick and stone, the walls being loopholed. The original
entrance had been on the northern side, but had been blocked, a small
breach in the southern wall being used in its stead. As this breach in
the wall was the only entrance to the fort, it was naturally covered by
the defenders on the inside, making passage through it into the fort a
most hazardous undertaking for the leading men. Notwithstanding the
fact that the fire of the Cacos was constantly passing through this
hole in the wall, Sergt. Ross L. Iams, Fifth Company, unhesitatingly
jumped through, closely followed by Pvt. Samuel Gross, of the
Twenty-third Company. A m&#234;l&#233;e then ensued inside of the fort for about
10 minutes, the Cacos fighting desperately with rifles, clubs, stones,
etc., during which several jumped from the walls in an effort to
escape, but were shot by the automatic guns of the Fifth Company and by
the Thirteenth Company advancing to the attack."

walls of brick and stone, the walls being loopholed. The original
entrance had been on the northern side, but had been blocked, a small
breach in the southern wall being used in its stead. As this breach in
the wall was the only entrance to the fort it was naturally covered by
the defenders on the inside, making passage through it into the fort a

escape, but were shot by the automatic guns of the Fifth Company and by

German submarine <i>U-90</i>, on May 21, 1918, Lieutenant Isaacs was
captured and held as a prisoner on board the <i>U-90</i> until the
return of the submarine to Germany, when he was confined in the prison
camp. During his stay on the <i>U-90</i> he obtained information of the
movements of German submarines which was so important that he
determined to escape, with a view to making this information available
to the United States and allied naval authorities. In attempting to
carry out this plan he jumped through the window of a rapidly moving
train, at the imminent risk of death, not only from the nature of the
act itself but from the fire of the armed German soldiers who were
guarding him. Having been recaptured and reconfined, he made a second
and successful attempt to escape, breaking his way through barbed-wire
fences and deliberately drawing the fire of the armed guards in the
hope of permitting others to escape during the confusion. He made his
way through the mountains of southwestern Germany, having only raw
vegetables for food, and at the end swam the River Rhine during the
night in the immediate vicinity of German sentries." (Act of February

<p>
"On October 22, 1915, Captain Upshur, First Lieutenant Ostermann, First
Lieutenant Miller, Assistant Surgeon Borden, and 35 enlisted men of the
Fifteenth Company of Marines, all mounted, left Fort Liberte, Haiti,
for a six-day reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of October 24,
while crossing river in deep ravine, the detachment was suddenly fired
upon from three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100
yards from fort. The marine detachment fought its way forward to a good
position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a
continuous fire from the Cacos. At daybreak the marines, in three
squads, commanded by Captain Upshur, Lieutenant Ostermann, and Gunnery
Sergeant Daly, advanced in three different directions, surprising and
scattering the Cacos in all directions. The expeditionary commander
commented on the gallantry displayed by the officers and men of this
detachment in the following language:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The action of the 35 men in the attack made upon them during the
night of October 24 can not be commended too highly. It is true
that these men were in pitch darkness, surrounded by ten times
their number, and fighting for their lives, but the manner in which
they fought during that long night, the steady, cool discipline
that prevented demoralization is remarkable. Had one squad failed,
not one man of the party would have lived to tell the story. The
actual assault upon the enemy, made in three different directions
and beginning as soon as the light permitted them to see, was
splendid. It meant success or utter annihilation. It succeeded,
thanks to the splendid examples given by the officers and
noncommissioned officers, supported by the men. Upshur and
Ostermann advancing from two directions captured Fort Dipitie, with
a total of 13 Marines, putting garrison to flight. Demolished and
burned fort. All three squads burned all houses from which fire had
been coming. I believe, therefore, that Capt. William P. Upshur,
First Lieut. Edward A. Ostermann, and Gunnery Sergt. Daniel Daly
should be given medals of honor for this particular engagement and
the work of the following day."

that followed, his plane shot down one of the enemy scouts. His
observer was shot through the elbow and his gun jammed. He cleared the
jam with one hand while Talbot maneuvered to gain time, and then
returned to the fight. The observer fought until shot twice, once in
the stomach and once in the hip. When he collapsed Lieutenant Talbot
attacked the nearest enemy scout with his front guns and shot him down.
With his observer unconscious and his motor failing, he dived to escape
the balance of the enemy and crossed the German trenches at an altitude
of 50 feet, landing at the nearest hospital and left his observer, and
returned to his aerodrome." (Act of February 4, 1919.)

"On October 22, 1915, Captain Upshur, First Lieutenant Ostermann, First
Lieutenant Miller, Assistant Surgeon Borden, and 35 enlisted men of the
Fifteenth Company of Marines, all mounted, left Fort Liberte, Haiti,
for a six-day reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of October 24,
while crossing river in deep ravine, the detachment was suddenly fired
upon from three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100
yards from fort. The marine detachment fought its way forward to a good
position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a
continuous fire from the Cacos. At daybreak the marines, in three
squads, commanded by Captain Upshur, Lieutenant Ostermann, and Gunnery
Sergeant Daly, advanced in three different directions, surprising and
scattering the Cacos in all directions. The expeditionary commander
commented on the gallantry displayed by the officers and men of this
detachment in the following language:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"The action of the 35 men in the attack made upon them during the
night of October 24 can not be commended too highly. It is true
that these men were in pitch darkness, surrounded by ten times
their number, and fighting for their lives, but the manner in which
they fought during that long night, the steady, cool discipline
that prevented demoralization is remarkable. Had one squad failed,
not one man of the party would have lived to tell the story. The
actual assault upon the enemy, made in three different directions
and beginning as soon as the light permitted them to see, was
splendid. It meant success or utter annihilation. It succeeded,
thanks to the splendid examples given by the officers and
noncommissioned officers, supported by the men. Upshur and
Ostermann, advancing from two directions, captured Fort Dipitie
with a total of 13 marines, putting garrison to flight. Demolished
and burned fort. All three squads burned all houses from which fire
had been coming. I believe, therefore, that Capt. William P.
Upshur, First Lieut. Edward A. Ostermann, and Gunnery Sergt. Daniel
Daly should be given medals of honor for this particular engagement
and the work of the following day."

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
